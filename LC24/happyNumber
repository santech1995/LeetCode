//Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.A happy number is a number defined by the following process:Starting with any 
positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will 
stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.Return true if n 
is a happy number, and false if not.


class Solution {
	public boolean isHappy(int n){
		int slow = n;
		int fast = n;
		do {
			slow =  square(slow);
			fast = square(square(fast));
		} while(slow != fast);
		return slow == 1;
	}
	public square(int num){
		int ans = 0;
		while(num > 0){
			int rem = num % 10;
			ans += rem * rem;
			num /= 10;
		}
		return ans;
	}
}
